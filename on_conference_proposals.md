# On Conference Proposals
## Or, writing an abstract is, basically, writing an introduction

The task for your last homework/Ã©tude, is to draft a conference proposal for the paper you are revising. It should, effectively, be a condensed version of your draft introduction: 
* three paragraphs long; 
* organized by one or more stasis/destabilization pairs; 
* propose a payoff or benefit; 
* articulate a scholarly or intellectual problem; 
* state a clear agenda in the paper; and 
* be not more than 300 words. 
 
I have uploaded my most recent conference proposal (for SCMS 2022) to the #reading channel on our Slack as a possible model.

As with all of our writing assignments, this is to be a rough draft. We will select one or more proposals to work discuss together.
